# 🎯 RabbitMQ Pattern Selection - The Ultimate Cheat Sheet

## 🚀 Quick Decision Process

### Step 1: Answer These Questions

1. **How many consumers should get each message?**
2. **Should consumers compete or collaborate?**
3. **Do you need filtering/routing logic?**

### Step 2: Use This Decision Matrix

| Your Needs                     | Pattern        | Exchange Type | Example                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| **One consumer gets message**  | Simple Queue   | Default       | Chat message user→user    |
| **Distribute work among many** | Work Queue     | Default       | Image processing tasks    |
| **All consumers get message**  | Pub/Sub        | Fanout        | News broadcast            |
| **Filter by exact criteria**   | Direct Routing | Direct        | Route by log level        |
| **Filter by patterns**         | Topic Routing  | Topic         | Route by `user.*.created` |

## 🏢 Real-World Business Cases

### 🛒 E-commerce Platform

```
Customer places order →
├─ Work Queue: Order processing (load balanced)
├─ Pub/Sub: Notify all services (inventory, email, analytics)
├─ Direct Routing: Send to regional fulfillment center
└─ Simple Queue: Send confirmation email to customer
```

### 📱 Social Media App

```
User posts content →
├─ Pub/Sub: Broadcast to all followers
├─ Work Queue: Process images/videos (thumbnail generation)
├─ Direct Routing: Notifications by type (like, comment, share)
└─ Simple Queue: Direct messages between users
```

### 🏦 Banking System

```
Transaction occurs →
├─ Work Queue: Fraud detection processing
├─ Pub/Sub: Real-time balance updates to all user devices
├─ Direct Routing: Alerts by severity (fraud→security, large→manager)
└─ Topic Routing: Audit logs by department.action.result
```

### 🏥 Healthcare System

```
Patient data updated →
├─ Work Queue: Medical analysis processing
├─ Pub/Sub: Notify all authorized healthcare providers
├─ Direct Routing: Alerts by urgency (critical, normal, info)
└─ Topic Routing: department.*.patient_update
```

## 🎭 Pattern Characteristics

### 📨 Simple Queue

- **Best for:** Direct communication, simple workflows
- **Performance:** ⚡⚡⚡ Fastest
- **Complexity:** 😌 Simplest
- **Scaling:** 📈 Limited (1-to-1)

### 📋 Work Queue

- **Best for:** CPU-intensive tasks, background jobs
- **Performance:** ⚡⚡ Fast
- **Complexity:** 😌 Easy
- **Scaling:** 📈📈📈 Excellent horizontal scaling

### 📡 Pub/Sub (Fanout)

- **Best for:** Event broadcasting, real-time updates
- **Performance:** ⚡⚡ Fast (but depends on slowest consumer)
- **Complexity:** 😐 Medium
- **Scaling:** 📈📈 Good (but limited by fan-out)

### 🎯 Direct Routing

- **Best for:** Department-based routing, priority handling
- **Performance:** ⚡ Medium (routing overhead)
- **Complexity:** 😐 Medium
- **Scaling:** 📈📈 Good

### 🔀 Topic Routing

- **Best for:** Complex multi-tenant systems, microservices
- **Performance:** 🐌 Slower (pattern matching overhead)
- **Complexity:** 😵 Most complex
- **Scaling:** 📈 Limited (pattern matching is expensive)

## ⚠️ Performance Considerations

### High Throughput Needs

1. **Simple Queue** or **Work Queue** (fastest)
2. Avoid Topic exchanges (pattern matching is slow)
3. Use persistent connections
4. Batch messages when possible

### High Availability Needs

1. Use **durable queues** and **persistent messages**
2. Set up **clustering** for RabbitMQ
3. Implement **manual acknowledgments**
4. Use **dead letter exchanges** for error handling

### Low Latency Needs

1. Prefer **Simple Queues**
2. Use **non-persistent messages** if acceptable
3. Avoid complex routing
4. Keep message sizes small

## 🧪 Testing Your Architecture Decision

### Load Testing Questions

- ✅ Can it handle your peak message rate?
- ✅ What happens when a consumer goes down?
- ✅ How does it scale when you add consumers?
- ✅ What's the end-to-end latency?

### Operational Questions

- ✅ Can you monitor queue lengths?
- ✅ Can you add/remove consumers easily?
- ✅ How do you handle failed messages?
- ✅ Can you replay messages if needed?

## 🎪 Mixing Patterns (Advanced)

Most real applications use **multiple patterns**:

```go
// Order processing system uses ALL patterns:

// 1. Simple Queue: User-specific notifications
ch.Publish("", "user_notifications_" + userID, notification)

// 2. Work Queue: Background processing
ch.Publish("", "order_processing", order)

// 3. Pub/Sub: System-wide events
ch.Publish("order_events", "", orderCreated)

// 4. Direct Routing: Regional handling
ch.Publish("regional_orders", order.Region, order)

// 5. Topic: Complex audit logging
ch.Publish("audit_logs", "order.created."+region+"."+priority, auditLog)
```

## 🎯 Final Decision Flowchart

```
Do you need message routing/filtering?
├─ NO → Do you need load balancing?
│   ├─ YES → 📋 Work Queue
│   └─ NO → 📨 Simple Queue
└─ YES → What kind of routing?
    ├─ Send to ALL interested → 📡 Pub/Sub (Fanout)
    ├─ Send by exact criteria → 🎯 Direct Routing
    └─ Send by patterns → 🔀 Topic Routing
```

## 🎓 Graduation Test

**Can you choose the right pattern for these scenarios?**

1. **Netflix video encoding** - Multiple workers encode different resolutions
2. **WhatsApp message delivery** - Message from user A to user B
3. **Stock price updates** - Broadcast to all trading platforms
4. **Customer support tickets** - Route by priority (high, medium, low)
5. **Multi-tenant SaaS logs** - Route by `tenant.service.level`

**Answers:**

1. Work Queue (load balance encoding tasks)
2. Simple Queue (direct user-to-user)
3. Pub/Sub (broadcast to all)
4. Direct Routing (route by priority)
5. Topic Routing (pattern matching)

**🎉 If you got these right, you understand RabbitMQ architectures!**
