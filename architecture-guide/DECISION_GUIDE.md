# 🏗️ RabbitMQ Architecture Decision Guide

## 🤔 The Big Question: "Which Pattern Should I Use?"

### Decision Tree 🌳

```
Do you need to send the SAME message to MULTIPLE consumers?
├─ YES → Do ALL consumers need the SAME message?
│   ├─ YES → 📡 PUB/SUB (Fanout Exchange)
│   └─ NO → Do you need filtering by criteria?
│       ├─ YES → 🎯 ROUTING (Direct Exchange)
│       └─ COMPLEX → 🔀 TOPIC (Topic Exchange)
└─ NO → Do you need load balancing among workers?
    ├─ YES → 📋 WORK QUEUE
    └─ NO → 📨 SIMPLE QUEUE
```

## 🎭 Real-World Scenarios & Patterns

### 📨 1. SIMPLE QUEUE

**When to use:** Direct 1-to-1 communication

```
[Producer] → Queue → [Consumer]
```

**Real Examples:**

- ✅ Chat messages between two users
- ✅ Simple task submission (file upload notification)
- ✅ Basic API to API communication
- ❌ DON'T use for: Multiple consumers, broadcasting

**Code Pattern:**

```go
// Direct queue binding (no exchange needed)
ch.Publish("", queueName, message)
```

---

### 📋 2. WORK QUEUE (Competing Consumers)

**When to use:** Distribute heavy work among multiple workers

```
[Producer] → Queue → [Worker1]
                  → [Worker2]
                  → [Worker3]
```

**Real Examples:**

- ✅ Image/video processing pipeline
- ✅ Email sending service (distribute among SMTP workers)
- ✅ Data processing jobs (ETL pipelines)
- ✅ Background task processing
- ❌ DON'T use for: Real-time notifications, broadcasting

**Business Case:** Netflix video encoding

- Upload video → Queue → Multiple encoding workers
- Each worker processes different resolutions
- Load balanced automatically

---

### 📡 3. PUB/SUB (Fanout Exchange)

**When to use:** Broadcast SAME message to ALL interested parties

```
[Publisher] → Exchange → Queue1 → [Subscriber1]
                      → Queue2 → [Subscriber2]
                      → Queue3 → [Subscriber3]
```

**Real Examples:**

- ✅ News/blog updates to all subscribers
- ✅ Price changes in e-commerce (update cache, analytics, etc.)
- ✅ System-wide notifications
- ✅ Real-time dashboard updates
- ❌ DON'T use for: Selective routing, load balancing

**Business Case:** Stock price updates

- Price change → ALL: Mobile apps, web dashboards, trading algorithms

---

### 🎯 4. ROUTING (Direct Exchange)

**When to use:** Send messages to SPECIFIC consumers based on criteria

```
[Producer] → Exchange ─(routing_key)→ Queue1 → [Consumer1]
                    └─(routing_key)→ Queue2 → [Consumer2]
```

**Real Examples:**

- ✅ Log routing by severity (error, warning, info)
- ✅ Geographic routing (US, EU, Asia queues)
- ✅ Department-specific notifications
- ✅ Priority-based task routing
- ❌ DON'T use for: Complex pattern matching, broadcasting to all

**Business Case:** Customer support system

- VIP customers → Priority queue → Senior agents
- Regular customers → Standard queue → Regular agents
- Technical issues → Tech queue → Technical team

---

### 🔀 5. TOPIC (Pattern Matching)

**When to use:** Complex routing with wildcards

```
[Producer] → Exchange ─(user.*.created)→ Queue1
                    └─(user.premium.*)→ Queue2
                    └─(*.*.deleted)─→ Queue3
```

**Real Examples:**

- ✅ Multi-tenant applications (tenant.service.action)
- ✅ Microservices event routing
- ✅ Complex logging systems
- ✅ Multi-region deployments
- ❌ DON'T use for: Simple routing, performance-critical paths

**Business Case:** E-commerce platform

- `order.payment.success` → Payment service, Inventory service
- `order.*.failed` → Error handling service
- `product.*.updated` → Cache service, Search service

---

## 🏢 Real Business Architecture Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Platform

```
User Places Order
├─ Work Queue: Order processing workers
├─ Pub/Sub: Notify all systems (inventory, analytics, email)
├─ Routing: Send to appropriate fulfillment center (US/EU/Asia)
└─ Topic: Complex event routing (user.order.created, payment.card.charged)
```

### Example 2: Social Media Platform

```
User Posts Content
├─ Pub/Sub: Broadcast to all followers' feeds
├─ Work Queue: Image processing workers (thumbnails, filters)
├─ Routing: Notifications by type (mention, like, comment)
└─ Simple Queue: Direct messages between users
```

### Example 3: Banking System

```
Transaction Processing
├─ Work Queue: Transaction validation workers
├─ Routing: Alert routing (fraud→security, large→manager)
├─ Pub/Sub: Real-time balance updates to all user devices
└─ Topic: Audit logging (user.*.transaction, admin.*.access)
```

## ⚖️ Architecture Decision Matrix

| Pattern      | Latency    | Scalability      | Complexity | Use When              |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Simple Queue | ⚡ Fastest | 📈 Limited       | 😌 Easiest | 1-to-1 communication  |
| Work Queue   | ⚡ Fast    | 📈📈📈 Excellent | 😌 Easy    | Load balancing needed |
| Pub/Sub      | ⚡ Fast    | 📈📈 Good        | 😐 Medium  | Broadcast required    |
| Routing      | 🐌 Medium  | 📈📈 Good        | 😐 Medium  | Selective delivery    |

## 🚨 Common Architecture Mistakes

### ❌ Anti-Patterns to Avoid:

1. **Using Pub/Sub for load balancing**

   ```go
   // WRONG: All workers get same task
   fanout → worker1, worker2, worker3 (all process same message)

   // RIGHT: Work queue distributes tasks
   queue → worker1 OR worker2 OR worker3 (only one processes)
   ```

2. **Using Work Queue for notifications**

   ```go
   // WRONG: Only one user gets the notification
   queue → user1 OR user2 OR user3

   // RIGHT: Pub/Sub sends to all users
   fanout → user1 AND user2 AND user3
   ```

3. **Over-engineering with Topic exchanges**

   ```go
   // WRONG: Complex when simple routing works
   "user.premium.payment.success.creditcard.visa"

   // RIGHT: Use direct routing
   "payment.success" with metadata in message
   ```

## 🎯 How to Choose: The 3-Question Method

### Question 1: "How many consumers need this message?"

- **One specific consumer** → Simple Queue or Work Queue
- **Multiple specific consumers** → Routing or Topic
- **All interested consumers** → Pub/Sub

### Question 2: "Do consumers compete or collaborate?"

- **Compete** (only one should process) → Work Queue
- **Collaborate** (all should process) → Pub/Sub

### Question 3: "How complex is the routing logic?"

- **No routing** → Simple Queue
- **Simple criteria** → Direct Routing
- **Pattern matching** → Topic Exchange

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

```
📧 Email system? → Work Queue (distribute among SMTP workers)
📱 Push notifications? → Pub/Sub (send to all user devices)
🚨 Error alerts? → Routing (errors→alerts, warnings→logs)
🔐 Multi-tenant SaaS? → Topic (tenant.service.action patterns)
💬 Chat messages? → Simple Queue (direct user-to-user)
📊 Analytics events? → Pub/Sub (send to multiple analytics services)

📈 Trading system? → Routing (route by instrument type/region)
```
